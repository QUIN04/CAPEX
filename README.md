Project Idea:
 It has been analyzed that the future platform would best be served by a newly developed infrastructure and code language. The language switch from Java to Python enables the Capacity Exchange's online longevity and sustainability. The aim is to leverage the larger Python community within the Wiki movement. As a result, a larger pool of developers can contribute to and maintain future additions – whether features or bug fixes. Analyzing data from Toolforge further strengthens the case for Python, as it demonstrates widespread language usage within the hosting platform. Out of the hosted tools, 43 mentions "python" as one of their tags, compared to only one tool mentioning "java".
Additionally, focusing on the two Python frameworks under consideration – Django and Flask – their presence on Toolforge is substantial, with 6 and 15 apps tagged, respectively. This reinforces Python language familiarity. It also highlights the advantage of selecting a framework with a strong presence among community developers. Transitioning to Python is a strategic action that aligns with the Wikimedia Movement. It takes advantage of the language's widespread adoption and robust frameworks. By doing so, CapX would benefit from increased contributions, a larger pool of potential developers, and an increased likelihood of long-term maintenance and success. Moreover, embracing Python will empower us to craft screens, user interfaces, and experiences that would otherwise be challenging. This is while building upon the current Java prototype. It will allow us to create a better peer-to-peer connection experience for all users

Implementation:
Capacity Exchange aims for an agile and participatory methodology, which includes planning activities, as observed in the present document. 
● Migration of functionalities that already exist, even partially. These are sections of code that already exist and would have to be rewritten in Python specifically with the framework Django. These are the ones we will focus on in this section.


● Development tasks are those pertaining to functionalities that don't exist in the current prototype. This will be done on the current prototype which will be realised using Django.

Detail documentation will done on every implementation of features and revised functionalities.
